        <strong>
          10. Freelance Services (very important &ndash; we only provide a
          platform)
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        General
        <br />
        10.1 Our Service is a neutral platform where self-employed Sellers can
        arrange to supply Freelance Services to Buyers. We do not supply those
        services. Any Freelance Contract is between the respective Seller and
        Buyer and the terms are for the parties to agree providing that they are
        consistent with this agreement. We are not a party to the Freelance
        Contract itself. You acknowledge that any legal recourse arising from
        breach of the Freelance Contract is against the other party to the
        Freelance Contract and not against us.
      </p>
      <p>
        10.2 You also separately agree with us that you will comply with each
        Freelance Contract.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          10.3 IMPORTANT: If you pass contact details to, and/or communicate
          with, another User outside our Service (including making payment):
        </strong>
        <br />
        <strong>• you do so at your own risk;</strong>
        <br />
        <strong>
          • you are not entitled to raise a Dispute (i.e., through our Service)
          and the references to Dispute in these terms don&rsquo;t apply; and
        </strong>
        <br />
        <strong>
          • the provisions relating to payment by the Buyer and to the Seller
          don&rsquo;t apply (if you make payment outside the Service).
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        10.4 You agree that we are allowed at any time to end or suspend any
        Freelance Contract by giving notice by email, SMS and/or in-app message
        if we consider that either party has broken this platform contract or
        this platform contract ends or it is necessary to protect either party.
        If so, we will refund the relevant fee to the Buyer subject any
        deduction that we consider reasonably appropriate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your obligations to the Buyer / Seller
        <br />
        10.5 The Sellers agree that in connection with supply of Freelance
        Services to the Buyer:
        <br />
        • it has and will maintain the necessary abilities (including licenses,
        permissions, qualifications, skills, training, expertise);
        <br />
        • it will supply the Freelance services with reasonable skill and care;
        and
        <br />• it will comply with all applicable laws and regulations
        (including data protection) and will not infringe any third party
        rights.
      </p>
      <p>
        10.6 Unless any Seller listing states, or the parties otherwise agree,
        that the following is not to apply, the Seller agrees with the Buyer
        that, on request by the Buyer, it will take reasonable steps to assign
        to the Buyer ownership of intellectual property rights in work that the
        Seller creates specifically for the Buyers provided the Buyer has paid
        in full for the work.
      </p>
      <p>
        10.7 You agree to deal with other Users in a polite and courteous manner
        and to respond promptly to communications from other Users.
      </p>
      <p>
        10.8 You agree to cooperate reasonably with the Buyer/Seller and to
        supply information reasonably requested by the other.
      </p>
      <p>
        Payment by Buyers (applies only if payment is made through the Service)
        <br />
        10.9 The Buyer must pay the relevant fee for Freelance Services to us in
        advance on behalf of the Seller as shown on our Service, which includes
        any applicable VAT. You authorise us and our payment provider to charge
        your payment card for the relevant amounts when payments are due in
        accordance with this agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        10.10 The Seller agrees that we are allowed to add our payment
        processing fee to the price to be charged to the Buyer and that this
        processing fee is payable by the Seller to us.
      </p>
      <p>
        Buyers&rsquo; legal right to cancel the Freelance Contract (“cooling
        off”)
        <br />
        10.11 If the Buyer is a Consumer and the Seller is a Professional, the
        Buyer may have the right to cancel the Freelance Contract subject to
        what we say below and as further explained at the end of this document.
        The Seller acknowledges that it is bound by and agrees to comply with
        these provisions.
      </p>
      <p>
        10.12 You lose the right to cancel contracts for the supply of services
        which have been fully performed, i.e. completed.
      </p>
      <p>
        10.13 You also lose the right to cancel where the supply of digital
        content began before the end of cancellation period with your specific
        agreement and you acknowledged that your right to cancel would be lost
        if this happened. Because Freelance Services generally involve the
        supply of digital content, in most cases you won&rsquo;t have the legal
        right to cancel your Freelance Contract with the Seller.
      </p>
      <p>
        Completion of job and (if applicable) Disputes
        <br />
        10.14 It is the responsibility of the Seller to confirm via our Service
        when the job has been completed and delivered. This step is referred to
        below as “Completion”.
      </p>
      <p>
        10.15 If the Buyer either:
        <br />
        • accepts the job after Completion; or
        <br />
        • fails within the number of days stated on our Service following
        Completion to accept the job or to request changes or to raise a Dispute
        <br />
        we are entitled to release the payment to the Seller.
      </p>
      <p>
        10.16 The Buyer can also raise a Dispute before Completion, for example
        if the Seller does not complete the job within the timescale agreed.
      </p>
      <p>
        10.17 The Seller can raise a Dispute at any time, for example if it
        thinks that the Buyer has not provided reasonable cooperation or that
        the Buyer has unreasonably requested changes following Completion.
      </p>
      <p>
        10.18 If a Dispute is raised, we will adjudicate on the dispute in our
        absolute discretion and our decision will be final. Our adjudication
        will relate only to allocation of the fees held by us and not any wider
        aspect of the dispute. We are entitled to allocate a full refund to the
        Buyer, to make full payment to the Seller or to split the payment
        between the parties as we consider appropriate. Both parties shall
        provide reasonable co-operation including supply of any information that
        we reasonably request. We are entitled to set or extend any deadlines we
        consider appropriate whether to allow the parties to try and resolve the
        dispute themselves, to require production of information, to make our
        decision or otherwise. We have no legal liability to either party in
        relation to our role as adjudicator.
      </p>
      <p>
        10.19 You agree not to raise a dispute directly with our payment
        provider (e.g., PayPal or Stripe).
      </p>
      <p>
        Payment to Sellers (applies only if payment is made through the Service)
        <br />
        10.20 Provided you have complied with your contract with us, we will
        take reasonable steps to pay you by crediting your account balance with
        the amount of the payment received from the Buyer less any deductions or
        Buyer refunds mentioned below (including deduction from funds credited
        to your account balance with us but not yet withdrawn). We will pay you
        after fourteen business days following:
        <br />
        • acceptance by the Buyer;
        <br />
        • the Buyer&rsquo;s failure to raise a Dispute or request changes within
        the relevant timescale; or
        <br />• if applicable, following our resolution of any Dispute (if we
        decide to make a payment to you).
      </p>
      <p>
        10.21 We are entitled in our discretion to refund to the Buyer on your
        behalf all or part of any Buyer payment insofar as the Buyer makes a
        complaint or raises a Dispute or cancels the order within any applicable
        cancellation period or if we otherwise consider it appropriate to make
        such a refund in our discretion (which may be based on any cancellation
        policy which applies at that time). You are liable to pay any
        appropriate refund direct to the Buyer if you have already withdrawn the
        relevant Buyer payment from your credit account with us.
      </p>
      <p>
        10.22 We are entitled to deduct from the payment due to you the amount
        of any chargeback which has arisen or which we consider is likely to
        occur (irrespective of whether the chargeback relates to the payment
        currently due). You agree to pay to us immediately on demand the amount
        of any chargeback relating to a payment which you have withdrawn from
        your credit account with us.
      </p>
      <p>
        10.23 You are responsible for making up any shortfall arising from
        charges made by your bank.
      </p>
      <p>
        10.24 You are responsible for taking your own tax advice and for
        accounting for any VAT that is due on sales made to Buyers. We are only
        responsible for accounting for any VAT on our fee that we charge to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        For Sellers only
        <br />
        10.25 If you haven&rsquo;t logged into your account for at least a week,
        we are entitled to place your account into vacation mode which means
        that Buyers will not be able to order Freelance Services from you.
      </p>
      <p>
        10.26 The Seller acknowledges that we do not guarantee that use of our
        Service of itself will necessarily enable compliance with all applicable
        laws and regulations concerning the Freelance Contract and it is the
        responsibility of the Seller to satisfy itself thereof.
      </p>
      <p>
        10.27 The Seller acknowledges that we do not guarantee that use of our
        Service will generate any particular level of revenues or suitable
        enquiries.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>11. Your Content (e.g., Seller listings, Reviews)</strong>

        alter, remove or delete Content or to disclose to the police or other
        relevant authorities or to a complainant any Content or behaviour if it
        is the subject of complaint or where we have reason to believe that it
        breaches our terms and conditions, or that such steps are necessary to
        protect us or others, or that a criminal offence may have been
        committed, or where required by law or where requested by the police or
        other appropriate authorities, or if we consider that Content does not
        meet our quality standards. If so, you must not attempt to re-publish or
        re-send the relevant Content.
      </p>
      <p>
        11.6 We are not legally responsible if your Content is misused by
        others. You must take reasonable care when deciding which Content to
        display on or send via our Service.

        11.7 We may place advertisements near or within your Content. If so, we
        retain all revenue from such advertisements.
      </p>
      <p>
        11.8 It is your responsibility to make your own frequent backups of

      <p>
        <strong>14. Our guidance</strong>
        <br />
        14.1 If we ourselves provide any guidance or other general information
        on or via our Service, we do not guarantee that it is accurate or up to
        date and we do not accept legal responsibility for it. Before acting on
        such information, you must make your own appropriate and careful
        enquiries including as to its accuracy and suitability for your
        purposes. You rely on such information at your own risk.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>15. If you create an account on our Service</strong>
        <br />
        15.1 Unless otherwise specifically stated on our Service, your account
        is for your personal use only. You must not allow any other person to
        use your account unless we specifically say otherwise. You agree to take
        reasonable care to keep your login information confidential and to tell

        or identity (unless and to the extent that we are at fault).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>16. Paying us</strong>
        <br />
        16.1 This section applies only to Sellers who pay us subscriptions and
        not to Buyers paying for Freelance Services (which is covered above
        under “Freelance Services”).
      </p>
      <p>
        16.2 Payment for subscriptions is in advance and covers the period
        specified.
      </p>
      <p>
        16.3 The prices shown include any applicable VAT unless we say
        otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
        16.4 You may only use any trial period for the purpose of a genuine
        assessment of the Service. You must not attempt to use the Service for
        more than one trial period. We can cancel your trial if we find that you
        have had access to a previous one.
      </p>
      <p>
        16.5 Your subscription will continue to be auto-renewed for the
        subscription period you signed up to unless you end your subscription
        with effect from the next renewal date by following the instructions on
        our Service. Ending your subscription does not entitle you to a refund
        (unless Consumer cooling off rights apply). You authorise us and our
        payment provider to place a hold on, or charge, your payment card for
        the relevant amounts or otherwise take payment whenever payments are due
        in accordance with this agreement. It is your responsibility to update
        your payment card details as necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
        16.6 We may at any time change our subscription prices. We will give you
        notice by email at least one month before any price change takes effect.
        If you do not agree with the new price, you should end your
        subscription. Otherwise, the next renewal of your subscription after the
        one month&rsquo;s notice will be at the new price.
      </p>
      <p>
        16.7 If we have mis-priced any part of our Service, we are not obliged
        to supply the Service at that price provided we notify you. If we do
        notify you, then you can decide if you want to continue with the Service
        at the correct price.
      </p>
      <p>
        16.8 You must contact us immediately with full details if you dispute
        any payment.

      <p>
        <strong>17. About discount codes</strong>
        <br />
        17.1 We may offer discount codes from time to time. Such codes may only
        be applied to purchases made through the account in respect of which the
        discount code was offered and registered and are not transferrable or
        redeemable for cash. Unless otherwise stated: codes (1) are only
        available for future new orders placed online; (2) cannot be used
        retrospectively; (3) can only be redeemed once per customer; and (4)
        expire after 12 months. You cannot use more than one discount code per
        transaction unless we state otherwise; if we do so, the order in which
        the codes are to be applied is in our sole discretion.
      </p>
      <p>
        17.2 We reserve the right to reject any discount code if we consider
        that it is being used in breach of these terms. Discount codes are
        subject to any additional specific terms and conditions which are
        specified at the point of issue. We reserve the right to discontinue or
        otherwise modify any discount codes at any time without prior notice.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>18. Affiliate scheme</strong>
        <br />
        18.1 This section of our terms and conditions applies to any referral or
        affiliate scheme on our Service &ndash; except insofar as the scheme
        description on our Service says something different &ndash; and provided
        we have specifically agreed with you in writing that the affiliate
        scheme applies to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        18.2 Subject to what we say below, you qualify for commission if the
        referred person:
        <br />
        • clicks on the referral link we provide, accepts cookies and registers
        on our Service within 30 days (or earlier cookie expiry); and
        <br />
        • within 12 months of registration makes a payment as a Buyer that we
        have passed on to the relevant Seller following completion of the job
        and resolution of any Dispute.
        <br />
        We call this a “Referral Event”.
      </p>
      <p>
        18.3 If you have a “business partner account”, subject to what we say
        below, you also qualify for commission if during the affiliation period
        that we have specified the referred person:
        <br />
        • clicks on the referral link we provide, accepts cookies and registers
        on our Service within 30 days (or earlier cookie expiry); and
        <br />
        • within 12 months of registration receives a payment as a Seller.
        <br />
        We call this a “Referral Event”.
      </p>
      <p>18.4 You cannot refer yourself.</p>
      <p>
        18.5 For each qualifying Referral Event, and provided you are still a
        registered User, we will take reasonable steps to pay you by crediting
        your account balance on our Service within 14 days thereafter the
        relevant percentage commission applied to the net payment made to the
        Seller (i.e., less payment provider fees) and also net of any VAT.
      </p>
      <p>
        18.6 We can refuse to pay you if we think that you have broken your
        contract with us or haven&rsquo;t complied with any applicable scheme
        requirements or that you have behaved inappropriately towards us or
        other Users or that you have cheated or attempted to cheat or if we have
        not been able to make the payment despite making reasonable efforts to
        do so.
      </p>
      <p>
        18.7 The scheme is subject to any deadlines or timescales specified and
        we are anyway entitled to change or end it at any time without notice.
      </p>
      <p>

        <br />
        19.1 The Service includes support only insofar as specifically provided
        for within the Service and, if so, by the specified contact methods. Any
        support service is only intended to address configuration and proper use
        of, or any errors or interruptions arising from, our Service.
      </p>
      <p>
        19.2 Unless otherwise stated, we do not guarantee any particular
        response times or outcomes. Any response times given are English
        business hours/days unless we say otherwise.
      </p>

        the email address shown below and, if you are an App User, by
        uninstalling the App from all of your devices. (This doesn&rsquo;t
        entitle you to a refund unless you have Consumer “cooling off” rights,
        explained above.)
      </p>
      <p>
        20.2 We are entitled to end this contract or suspend part or all of our
        Service or impose restrictions on our Service if:
        <br />
        • you break this contract;

        • you become bankrupt or go into liquidation or similar or become
        insolvent;
        <br />
        • you are subject to repeated Buyer complaints and/or negative Reviews;
        <br />
        • any fees payable by you are unpaid / unjustifiably charged back;
        <br />
        • acting reasonably, we think that it is necessary to protect you, us or
        others;
        <br />
        • we are required to do so by applicable law or regulation or to comply
        with an order, instruction or request from a competent authority; or
        <br />• you or anyone on your behalf acts inappropriately towards our
        staff.
      </p>
      <p>
        20.3 If you are a Seller and we end the contract, we will give you at
        least 30 days&rsquo; notice unless we have a legal or regulatory
        obligation, or a legal right, to end it earlier, or you have repeatedly
        broken this contract.
      </p>
      <p>
        20.4 We are entitled at any time to end this contract if we terminate
        our Service as a whole if in our reasonable opinion it is necessary to
        do so for security, technical or operational reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
        20.5 If this contract ends:
        <br />
        • It still continues insofar as necessary to facilitate any pending
        Freelance Contracts you entered into before termination unless we
        terminate those contracts, in which case we will refund the applicable
        payment to the Buyer subject any deduction which we consider reasonably
        appropriate.
        <br />
        • If you are a Seller, it is your responsibility to withdraw any funds
        in your account balance with us within 14 days of the end of the
        contract; otherwise we are entitled to retain these funds.
        <br />
        • Subject to the above, your right to use our Service and all licences
        are terminated.
        <br />
        • Existing rights and liabilities are unaffected.
        <br />
        • All clauses in this contract which are stated or intended to continue
        after termination will continue to apply.
        <br />• After the end of the contract, we may retain access to
        information provided or generated by Sellers and Buyers in order to deal
        with disputes, enforce our terms and conditions or manage or improve our
        Service generally. See our <Link href="/privacy">

      <p>
        21.3 To enable us to send alerts, you must ensure you give us correct
        contact information and immediately update us if it changes. We are not
        responsible for checking or updating your contact information even if we
        have reason to think that it is wrong or out of date (e.g., because our
        email is returned). In any case, you accept the risk that for whatever
        reason alerts may not be correctly sent out by our Service or received
        by the intended recipient and you must diarise key dates and/or follow
        up communications as appropriate.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>22. Compatibility of App</strong>
        <br />
        22.1 We do not guarantee that the App is or will be compatible with any
        particular mobile devices or associated operating systems (OS&rsquo;s).
        You acknowledge that the supplier of the device or OS may issue an
        update that causes our App to stop working. We may issue App updates
        through the Store; if so, you may not be able to use our App properly or
        at all until you have downloaded the update, which may be subject to
        agreement to new terms and conditions. It is your responsibility to
        frequently monitor for App updates and to install them as soon as they
        become available.

        or fraudulent misrepresentation or for anything which may not legally be

      </p>
      <p>
        23.2 If you are a Consumer, we shall not be liable for any loss or

        <br />
        • there is no breach of a legal duty owed to you by us;
        <br />
        • such loss or damage was not reasonably foreseeable (meaning it was not
        an obvious consequence of our breach or not contemplated by you and us
        at the time we entered into this contract);
        <br />
        • (and to the extent that) such loss or damage is your fault, for
        example by not complying with this agreement; or
        <br />• such loss or damage relates to a business of yours.
      </p>
      <p>
        23.3 If you are a Consumer, you will be responsible to us for any
        reasonably foreseeable loss or damage we suffer (including claims made
        by other people) resulting from your breach of this agreement or misuse

        first act or omission complained of.
        <br />
        • In no event (including our own negligence) will we be liable for any:
        <br />
        • economic losses (including, without limit, loss of revenues, profits,
        contracts, business or anticipated savings);
        <br />
        • loss of goodwill or reputation;
        <br />
        • special, indirect or consequential losses; or
        <br />
        • damage to or loss of data
        <br />
        (even if we have been advised of the possibility of such losses).

        • You will indemnify us against all claims and liabilities directly or
        indirectly related to your use of the Service and/or breach of this

        imposed by statute or by law or otherwise, that are not expressly stated
        in this agreement.
        <br />• This agreement constitutes the entire agreement between us with
        respect to its subject matter and supercedes any previous communications
        or agreements between us. We both acknowledge that there have been no
        misrepresentations and that neither of us has relied on any
        pre-contractual statements. Liability for misrepresentation (excluding
        fraudulent misrepresentation) relating to the terms of this agreement is
        excluded.

        use such material including copying, publishing, selling or adapting it
        or taking extracts from it without our specific prior written consent
